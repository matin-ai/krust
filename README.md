# krust

a new blockchain with the given difficulty. It first creates a new variable to store the difficulty of the blockchain and then uses it to create a new blockchain with the same difficulty. Finally, it adds a block to the blockchain.

Improvements
// Create a variable to store the difficulty of the blockchain let difficulty = 1; // Create a new blockchain with the given difficulty let mut blockchain = models::blockchain::Blockchain::new(difficulty); // Add a block to the blockchain models::blockchain::Blockchain::add_block(&mut blockchain);
One possible improvement to the code could be to make use of a function to add a block to the blockchain instead of directly calling the add_block method. This would make the code more readable and modular.

Another improvement could be to make use of a loop to add multiple blocks to the blockchain instead of just one.

Bugs
One possible bug in the code could be that the difficulty variable is hard-coded to 1. This could lead to a blockchain with a very low difficulty, making it easier for attackers to manipulate the blockchain.
Another bug could be that the add_block method is called without passing any parameters, which could result in an empty block being added to the blockchain.

Possible Errors
One possible error in the code could be that the models module is not properly imported, resulting in the code being unable to use the Blockchain struct or the add_block method.
